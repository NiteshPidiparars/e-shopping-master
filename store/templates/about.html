				<h1>We Are Creative</h1>
				<p>Digital products, on the other hand, are something ecommerce businesses can sell online but theyâ€™re not an actual physical product that can be shipped to their customers. Oftentimes, once a digital product is purchased online a customer can download the digital files straight away with no need for the business to actually ship anything to the customer.Businesses can also provide digital or in-person services that their customers can purchase online. These services can include anything from design services or streaming services (both are digital services) to home improvement services or dog-walking services (which are in-person services). Any business that provides a service, rather than a physical or digital product, can be included in this category.</p>
